              In this project I built and designed an email system, serverless
              data handler and report generator using AWS SES, SNS, LAMBDA and
              S3. The Lambda function was written using Python, Pandas and
              ReportLab.

              The project set out to design and build an integration for a third
              party mining companyâ€™s cement mixing process. The various machines
              on the plants were linked up to Ewon modems and they were
              recording data points in isolated databases.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The integration I built draws data from these individual databases
              and is triggered with an email request. It uses Pandas to isolate
              the requested data and manages data cleaning. It then merges them
              into a single dataframe, creates summaries, and lastly formats it
              into a pdf report using ReportLab. This is sent as an attached pdf
              via email to the required parties.
